PROBLEM STATEMENT:
H-1B visas are a category of employment-based, non-immigrant visas for temporary foreign workers in the United States. 
For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, a US employer must offer them a job and submit a petition for a H-1B visa to the US immigration department. 
This is also the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position.
This dataset contains five year's worth of H-1B petition data, with approximately 3 million records overall. 
The columns in the dataset include case status, employer name, worksite coordinates, job title, prevailing wage, occupation code, and year filed.
We used 100,605 data for quicker response.
